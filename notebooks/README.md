These Jupyter Notebooks show two things:

1) Patching code to add the serial monitor, along with fixing some bugs.
2) How the DPA & glitch attacks worked.

They should render in the github interface.

The glitch/dpa attack was also described in Circuit Cellar (May 2023), and I had published the notebooks at https://github.com/colinoflynn/circuitcellar-EmbeddedSystemEssentials/blob/main/394_2023_05_MAY/Oven%20Hacky%20Test.ipynb.
